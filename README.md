# README

This is a shared library for (advanced) physics learning. All books are gathered on the Internet. Feel free to join us or download our files.

## How to use

Folders are named in `Camel-Case` manner with clear names of branches in physics. And reference books should be stored in the sub-folder named `Books`, so as other helpful resources. Users can create their own folders named with whatever they like, but they should not make any confusion. One can upload some notes even codes in his folder, and these files would be treated public to others. So please make your files easy to read and do not modify others files. `Markdown` is recommended.
